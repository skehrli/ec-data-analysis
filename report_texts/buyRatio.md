The following bar chart aims to visualize the fairness of the employed market mechanism. For each community member, the ratio of their demand (consumption not covered by self-production) covered by purchases on the community market is shown, discretized to single percentage points. If a bar has height 10, it means that 10 community members have purchased this percentage of their demand on the community market. Each member wants this to be as high as possible, since purchasing from the local market is cheaper than purchasing from the grid.
