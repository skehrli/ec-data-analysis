The following bar chart aims to visualize the fairness of the battery charging allocation algorithm. For each community member, the ratio of energy 'sold to' the battery of the overall overproduction (production not used by self-consumption) is shown, discretized to single percentage points. If a bar has height 10, it means that 10 community members have sold this percentage of their supply to the battery. Each member wants this to be as high as possible, since 'selling to' the battery or local market yields higher prices than feeding into the grid.
