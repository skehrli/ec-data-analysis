The following bar chart aims to visualize the fairness of the employed market mechanism. For each community member, the ratio of their overproduction sold on the community market is shown, discretized to single percentage points. If a bar has height 10, it means that 10 community members have sold this percentage of their supply on the community market. Each member wants this to be as high as possible, since selling on the local market yields higher prices than feeding into the grid.
