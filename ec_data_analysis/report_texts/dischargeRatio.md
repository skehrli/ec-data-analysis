The following bar chart aims to visualize the fairness of the battery discharging allocation algorithm. For each community member, the ratio of energy obtained from the battery of the overall demand (consumption not covered by self-production) is shown, discretized to single percentage points. If a bar has height 10, it means that 10 community members have purchased this percentage of their demand from the battery. Each member wants this to be as high as possible, since purchasing from the battery or local market is cheaper than purchasing from the grid.
